Hello there! You wouldn’t happen to have caught a shark recently have you? I’ve been trying to perfect this recipe for a lovely tasting soup, but I’m in need of some shark meat. If you catch a shark in your travels, do you think you could bring it to me? I just know this will be my best soup yet! I've been trying to catch one myself with my new lure. It's supposed to be good for those deep-sea fish, but I haven't had any luck with it. You can have the lure if you bring me a shark.
