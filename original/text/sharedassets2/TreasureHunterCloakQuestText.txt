Hello Traveler. I wonder if I could talk you into helping an old treasure hunter out? Rumor has it that this island contains a treasure buried somewhere. Ive been searching for a while now but havent found anything. If you would be willing to help me search, Ill reward you for your time should you bring the treasure back to me.
