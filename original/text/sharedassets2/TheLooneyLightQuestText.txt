Greetings my future acquaintance! Hath thou lost thine light? I certainly hope not. For when the darkness falls, none of us will see! Not those with eyes like yours at least. But do not fear! I have the very thing you need. All our eyes will be bright again. But first you must face the darkness that blocks your path. Open the door to the home that is night and walk in without taking off your shoes! As you enter the blind abyss, could you gather me some items? I require a spider silk, three night vigor flowers, and five moonrock ore shards. Bring me those only at night, and I will show you the light.
