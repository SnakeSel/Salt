Boom! Scared you didnt I? Im afraid that wasnt a real boom though. No, a real boom is what you want. But to make a real boom, youre going to need the right stuff. Ive got the boom stuff, but in exchange Im going to need any treasure you find on this island. Once you have the buried treasure, bring it to me and Ill give you the boom stuff. That simple yeah?
