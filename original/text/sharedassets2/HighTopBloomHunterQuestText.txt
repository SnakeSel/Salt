Mmm hmmm... Greetings, friend. Would you be interested in purchasing anything from my wares? Oh, also, I have a special task for you if you are willing. You see, in my younger days, I was a great explorer. I explored every island in these parts thrice over, and I got particularly good at climbing to the top of the mountainous islands. Not only did I enjoy the view, there is a special type of flower that grows up high. This flower does wonders for your muscles when prepared properly. I am getting weaker as the years roll by, and I could do with a fresh batch of these flowers. The problem is, I am not the climber that I used to be. Bring me ten of these flowers and I will reward you with my old climbing boots. The flowers are orange in color. Look for them in the highest peaks.
