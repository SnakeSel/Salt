Hello Traveler. If you are interested, I have a task for you. Here recently I’ve been encountering some less than pleasant pirates in my shop. They often steal my things and harass me as they pillage my island. I’ve come up with an idea to get them back. I’m going to poison some rum and sell it to them. To do this however, I need three spider fangs. If you could get me these spider fangs, I can use a little bit of the poison to make an amulet for you that will help you to build up an immunity to the poison.
