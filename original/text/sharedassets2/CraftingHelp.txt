When you select the crafting tab in your inventory, the crafting interface will appear at the top of the window. When you select crafting components from your inventory, they will show up in the left set of boxes in the crafting interface. If the components can combine to create something, a new icon will appear in the right set of boxes. You can select this icon to craft it. You can find a list of basic crafting recipes in your crafting journal, which can be found in your general inventory tab.
