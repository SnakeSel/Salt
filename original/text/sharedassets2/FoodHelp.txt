On the bottom left of your screen is a set of bars. The green bar on bottom is your food meter. The lower it is, the more hungry you are. When this meter runs out, you will recover stamina at a much slower rate. As long as you have some food, your health will slowly regenerate over time. You can replenish your food by eating, and some food give you special effects. If you are too full to consume a food item, you will not be able to eat it until you are hungry enough, so choose wisely what you eat for your meals.
