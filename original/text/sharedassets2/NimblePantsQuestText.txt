Ah yes! A traveler with a need of new pantaloons! I've got just the thing for you. But hold your horses. These knickers aren't just give-away knickers. No, no. They are my pride and joy. I'll tell you what. If you search this island, you'll likely find some buried treasure. I've been searching myself but can't seem to find it. Maybe you'll have better luck! Find the treasure, bring it to me, and I'll don you a new pair of britches.
