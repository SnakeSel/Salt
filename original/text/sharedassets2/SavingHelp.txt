You can save the game at almost any time by pressing F5, or selecing "Save" from the pause menu. You cannot save while close to enemies.

Periodically during play, the game will auto-save. This is indicated by the saving icon that will appear in the bottom right of your screen when the game auto-saves and will look like a small animated ship's wheel.

When returning to your game, the most recent auto or manual save will be loaded by default. However, you can choose to specifically load the manual or the auto save files by pressing the gear button next to the save slot in the load menu within the main menu.
