Hello traveler, 

I'm sorry I'm not in the greatest of moods. You see, every year I go to visit my mother's grave, rest her soul. And when I do, I bring her her favorite flower and place it at her tombstone. The problem is that over time these flowers have grown more and more scarce. I dare say you are lucky to even hear about one anymore! 

The flower is called a Valtuila Lilly. They used to grow everywhere but for some unknown reason they've been fading out of existence. I did spot one recently however. 

A pirate came by here to buy some goods and I noticed he carried one with him. He referred to himself as some kind of herbalist. I tried to barter with him and get him to sell me the flower but he refused. I must have irritated him because he ended beat attacking me, stealing half my things, and leaving me for dead. 

If you come across any of these â€˜herbalists,' perhaps you'd be willing to obtain a Valtuila Lilly for me? I've got a fairly valuable ring that I would be willing to part with if you do.
