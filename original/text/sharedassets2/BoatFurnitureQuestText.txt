Hello there! You look as though youre in search of something valuable. Well youve come to the right island. Rumor has it this island has some buried treasure. I wouldve beaten you to it but I twisted my ankle. Im afraid I cant walk on it much so Ill have to pass the torch on to you. However, should you decide youd still like to bring me the treasure, Ill reward you for your time.
