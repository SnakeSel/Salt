As long as you have food, you will slowly regain health as time passes. If you wish for a different time of day, or want to heal up, you can pass time quickly by resting at a campfire. Campfires can be found in the world, or you can craft them and place them yourself. 

Campfires do not last forever, however. When your campfire burns out, it will disappear and you will have to craft or find a new one to rest again.
