Hello there Traveler! You wouldn’t be interested in helping out an old fisherman would ya? I’ve been fishing these parts for years and I can’t ever seem to catch the elusive fish known as the Dragonfish. I’ve built up quite a fish collection, but I’d really like to add one more to it. If you happen to catch this Dragonfish and bring it to me, I’d be happy to give you my old fishing pole. Oh! And by the way, the Dragonfish has been rumored to mainly stay in the deepest parts of the ocean. That might help set you on the right path.
