Traveler! You look like a fine sailor. Maybe you can help me out? Did you know there is buried treasure somewhere on this island? Word around the sea lead me here. I would go searching myself, but Im a bit tired from my travels. If youd be willing to search and find the treasure for me, Ive got something that might benefit you in your sailing expeditions.
