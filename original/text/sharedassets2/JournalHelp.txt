The journal is divided into sections. You can switch between these sections by pressing the bookmarks labeled Main, Quest, and Map at the top left of the journal interface. The main section of the journal is for you to keep notes about the game as you please. The quest section holds brief notes on quests that you encounter during play. This section is not editable, and will automatically updated during play. The map section corresponds to notes that you have made through your map.

To edit the main section of the journal, mouse over the quill icon at the bottom of the page that you wish to edit, and select either new entry or new section. If you chose to add a new section, it will create a link to a brand new section of the journal. Use sections to keep your journal better organized.
