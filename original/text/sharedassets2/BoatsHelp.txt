In order to travel around the world, you will need a boat. There are multiple ways to obtain boats including crafting one, repairing a damaged one, and as quest rewards. Once a boat is crafted, repaired, or obtained in another way, it will appear in your inventory under the boats tab. Interact with the boat item to place the boat. 

If your boat gets away from you, don't worry. You can always summon it back by once again interacting with the boat item from your inventory.

For easier placement, you can hotkey boat items just like any other item. See the "Hotkeys" section for more information.
