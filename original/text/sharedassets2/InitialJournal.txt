To the person unknown to me,

I happened upon you laying here while I was searching this island. I gave you a few hard shakes, but you did not respond. I thought that I would leave you this message in the event that you do eventually awake. I made a stop on this island to search for some provisions. While foraging, I ran upon an unlocked chest with a few materials in it. By the looks of you, I would find it strange if the chest was yours, but I left its contents untouched for you just in case.

It is unlikely that remaining on this island would be in your best interest. You might consider using the cloth I saw in there along with some wood to repair the broken raft on the shore here. Hopefully it has not drifted off to sea by the time you awake. If you are looking for more direction, there are a number of Inns scattered throughout the sea here. Find one, and talk to the man that runs it. Look for a light on the horizon. The innkeeper usually keeps a lantern out.
