I don’t know if you be the gatherin’ type or not. Let me look at ye… Mmm Hmm. I see me some GATHERIN’ HANDS! Ye been gathern’ ye some logs, haven’t ya? Mmm Hmm. Can’t resist, can ya? Hard to pass up, they are. ‘Specially them hardwood logs. Hard to spot they are, but to a trained eye, they pop out like a bald pirate on a hairy hill… Hmm. Ehh, nevermind. I never was too good at them simile-mabobs. Anywhosers, I get meself all in a ruffle everytime I see me a hardwood log layin’ there. I can’t pass ‘er up. Now I be sittin’ here with me an over-abundance. I don’t want to be burnin’ them for firewood. I'd rather be usin' regular logs for that. I’ll make ye a deal. I’ll give ye a whole stack of five hardwood logs if ye bring me thirty of them regular logs.
