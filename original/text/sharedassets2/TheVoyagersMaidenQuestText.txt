Divide my three… carry the one… Oh ho! Look at her. She’s a beauty, she is. Just look at that those curves. A good rounded base! Perfect! Here, take a look at these blueprints. See that? That’s the new ship I have been designing. I can’t wait to get to work. Do you know what I love more than anything? I love to design and build ships. Do you know what I hate more than anything? I hate collecting materials to build said ships. Yes. It is a sad state of mind, I know, but I am who I am. Can’t help it. But I see that you are a sailor. And a sailor likes a good ship, am I right? I’ll tell you what. I’ll make you a bit of a business proposition. You go collect the materials that I need to craft this new ship, plus a little bit of gold, and you will have yourself a new sailing ship. Lets see, where did I put that materials list? Here it is! Here is what I will need.

100 wood
20 hardwood
5 ironite
7 hardstone
20 cloth
500 gold
