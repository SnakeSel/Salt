As you explore, you will obtain items of all different sorts. These items are stored in your inventory. Each item icon will have a background color representing its quality or rarity, and may have a stack size number if the item is stackable.

When you open your inventory, you will notice two windows appear. The right-most window is your inventory while the left-most window shows all of the items you currently have equipped.


On the right side of the inventory there are a number of different tabs. These tabs work as filters for your items. The default tabs are:

- General Tab: Shows everything except boats.
- Usable Tab: Shows items that you can click to use in some way such as potions or bandages.
- Equipable Tab: Shows items that can be equipped.
- Crafting Tab: Opens crafting interface and shows items that can be used as crafting components.
- Boat Tab: Shows boats.

Other special tabs can be unlocked through gameplay.
