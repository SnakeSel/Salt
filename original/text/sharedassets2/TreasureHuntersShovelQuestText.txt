Adventurer! Can you help me? Yesterday I was roaming this island when a band of pirates came by. I was afraid they would rob me so I hid my treasure and buried it in the sand. My plan was successful as they didnt find it but now I seem to have another problem. I cant find it myself! If you could help me I would greatly appreciate it! Find my treasure, bring it back to me, and I will be sure to reward you with something worthy of any good treasure hunter.
