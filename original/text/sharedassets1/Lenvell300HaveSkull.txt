Ah yes! I see you've found the skull. I'm afraid I kept a small detail about the artifact from you. The skull is actually a cursed artifact. 

Yes, yes, I know it was wrong of me. But if you only understood the peril the skull can wreck on the world, you would see why it's important that it falls into the right hands! I knew that only a person with true bravery and grit could remove the curse. After speaking to the Innkeeper, I determined that you were the right person for the job. I want you to remove the curse. 

Throughout the world there are a group of people who still practice a dark and ancient magic. They are known as cultists. I've read countless books on such people and they often carry with them tomes that contain information on curses and rituals. According to legend, they can be found worshipping throughout the night around ritual sites. Find these cultists and see if you can obtain some information on how to remove the curse. Once you have the information you need, you'll know what to do.
