Tools of Battle vol. 2
By: Horace the Iron Master

Bombs are useful in a number of ways, whether for clearing a camp of pirates, or to loose ores from stones. They can also be quite dangerous to the bomber, so keep your distance. I'm going to tell you about two types of bombs that you can craft.

Volatile Ore
The primary ingredient in the types of bombs described in these pages is called volatile ore. This is a very useful and quite dangerous substance found within certain boulders. These boulders are often found jutting from the sandy terrain of the grassless island that I call desert islands. One must be extremlely careful when extracting the ore, as it is very prone to explode when struck. I hear that there are tools that aid in this endeavor, but that is outside of my expertise.


Volatile Bomb
These are the most simple to craft, and I find them incredibly useful and easy to use. You can make a few with one chunk of volatile ore placed inside a round shell of hardstone. The lack of padding inside the shell means that the bomb will explode upon impact. Give it a strong toss and be sure not to drop one.

Fused Bomb
A fused bomb is a slightly more complicated variant of the volatile bomb, but it has its advantages. It is created similarly to the volatile bomb, but also use a cloth for padding inside of the shell, and some plant fibers for a fuse. These bombs will not explode on impact, but instead are timed using the fuse. They also pack more of a punch than their volatile counterparts so make sure you are extra far away when they pop.
