You've done well so far. Now I've got a new task for you. I recently have lost my bookmarker and that makes it quite hard to remember where I was when reading a book. Can you believe someone suggested to me to just turn the page corner down? Ha! What an imbecile. 

Anyways, I'm looking for a silk bookmarker. It's a very specific type and is usually made with spider silk. I'm betting that some poachers might have some in their possessions. If memory serves me correctly, poachers can usually be found wandering jungle islands. 

Find a poacher and see if he has a Silk Bookmarker on him. Oh and...ask nicely will you?
