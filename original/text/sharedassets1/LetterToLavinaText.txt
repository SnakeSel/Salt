Dear Lavina, 

I'm writing this letter to let you know how much I miss you. With each day that passes I feel less enjoyment from day to day. The things that normally make me happy pale in comparison to your presence. Food doesn't taste the same. The sunshine isn't as bright. And I'm afraid the only cure for me is you. 

I've spoken to the Captain about returning home for a few weeks and he has approved my request. I'll be departing in a few days and will hopefully arrive shortly after you get this letter. To be honest, I'm not sure I can leave you again. Maybe I can leave this pirate life behind and become a trader, that way I can be at home, closer to you and little Joseph. 

How's he doing by the way? He's got to be at least two or three since I've last seen him.

At any rate, I hope this letter finds you well. Be seeing you soon my dear.
