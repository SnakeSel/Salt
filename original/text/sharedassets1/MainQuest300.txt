You've proven to be a very capable adventurer, if I do say so myself. I suppose you're ready for a more dangerous task. I know a fellow who goes by the name of Lenvell. He occasionally stops by my inns so be on the lookout for him during your travels. In fact, if you wait here for a while, it is possible he will show up. You are free to use any of the beds in my inn. Once you find him, tell him I sent you and he'll know what it's about.
