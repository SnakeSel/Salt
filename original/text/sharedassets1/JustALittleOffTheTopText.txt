If you are the adventuring type, I've got a proposition for you. A few days ago, a band of pirates stopped by my inn and roughed up the place pretty good. During their ransacking they stole my favorite hat! Oh how I loved that hat. We had bonded over the years. At any rate, the pirates couldn't have gone far and are most likely on an island nearby. If you bring my hat back I'll let you in on some information you will most certainly find valuable. And don't worry about finding me. I travel around a good bit so you should be able to find me at most inns.
