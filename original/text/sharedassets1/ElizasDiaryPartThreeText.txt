Eliza's Diary Part Three

Entry 5

I can’t explain it but as I sat there in the forest at night next to Thomas, I knew something bad was about to happen. A strange and dreadful sensation had washed over me as I realized the forest was darker than I had ever seen it before. 

Before I could warn Thomas of my strange feeling, I heard a whistling sound. At first I wasn’t sure if I was really hearing the sound or if it was just in my head. I looked at Thomas and by his expression I knew he was hearing it as well. The whistling sound seem to travel through the forest at every corner and I could not tell where it was coming from. My eyes darted around looking for any sign of danger but all I could see was darkness beyond the torch light. 


Entry 6

Thomas quickly grabbed my hand and pulled me behind him. I could see his eyes searching the darkness just as mine were. His bow was ready and he seemed more than willing to protect me in the event of danger. As the whistling carried on Thomas lead me through the forest. We had to find out what was causing this sound! After walking for a while through the forest we saw something eclipse quickly under our torch light. It appeared to be a giant statue!
