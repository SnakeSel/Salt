I'm afraid I don't know very much about that ring. What I do know is this. A long time ago there was said to be a powerful alchemist by the name of Salin. Apparently, Salin was fascinated with certain dark creatures and wished to study them, though he was not very skilled in combat. He fashioned a ring that he believed would protect him from such creatures. Shortly after crafting the ring he went out on one of his adventures. No one ever saw or heard from him again. I'm not sure how you obtained the ring, but that may give you some hint as to what happened to the poor soul.
