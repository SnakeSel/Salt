Listen...there's something I need to tell you. You might have noticed that I don't play music myself anymore. The reason for this is...well...it's my last apprentice. 

You see, years ago I took on an apprentice for the first time. We spent years playing music, crafting new instruments, and exploring the sea in search of inspiration for new songs. Eventually, I married her. Her name was Lilly. 

A few months ago though something horrible happened. We were camping out on an island and we were attacked by a vicious monster. It was a giant spider. It got ahold of Lilly before I could do anything and...well, she's gone now. I barely escaped with my own life but I haven't been able to bear the thought of playing music again. Every time I do it reminds of her. 

But then you came along, and I saw that music wasn't just about me. The song is king and the music must carry on, not in spite of, but in honor of my wife. Lilly would have wanted that. 

With that said, I'm ready to exact vengeance on the monster that killed my wife. You've been a great apprentice, and I'd like to give that honor to you. 

I've spent a lot of time concocting this scent that I believe will lure the beast to you. Use it, kill the giant spider, and bring me it's silk.
