If there's one thing being a pirate has taught me, it's the importance of gold. Gold can buy a man freedom, adventure, and whatever his heart desires. Yet this search for gold remains an ongoing struggle. I've spent years searching for treasure and doing everything I can to obtain more gold, only to still find myself needing more. 

I've heard of a mysterious eye patch that gives one some sort of ability to find more gold. Yes, it sounded just as strange to me when I first heard it. But I've seem to run out of options. I need to find this eye patch so I can finally quench this unending thirst for gold! If I know pirates (and I do being as I am one) some lucky lad is liable to have it on him out there somewhere. Guess I better get to searching
