Every man or woman who has ever dared to venture towards the horizon has found one of three things: life, death, or the sea. The pursuit of the unknown leads into a search of oneself, rather than a search for what's external. Adventure breeds discomfort which breeds introspection and honesty. This is where life is found. 

Beyond the horizon lies many possibilities, some great, some terrible, and some greatly terrible. Danger awaits those willing to trek into the unknown. Make no mistake, the path to discovering your true self is not safe, nor will it ever be safe. But who said anything about safe? Some may find death along the way. Though, death is quite ordinary, don't you think? It's life and true living that is rare. 


Some of those who venture into the unknown discover a world they didn't quite realize existed: the sea. The sea is full of limitless possibilities, never knowing what waits beyond the horizon. Storms and waves make every day an adventure and a struggle. Though it is through the struggle for life that we are truly born. 

In your time on this great planet, always be on the search for progress. If you find life, hold onto it. If death greets you, know that your life has been full. And should you prove infinitely lucky and discover life at sea, well...never quit sailing.
