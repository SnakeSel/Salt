If you're taking an interest in the Sea Scholar's Guild, I suppose I should give you some more information about us. 

We Sea Scholars take the pursuit of knowledge very seriously. It has always been our goal to obtain as much knowledge as possible about our world, the people in it, and any and everything that could further the advancement of truth. 

If you plan on being a member of the Sea Scholar's Guild, you will need to continue your pursuit of knowledge daily. This means should you find new books or texts, you should honor these, read them, and consider donating them to the guild for further research.

That about sums it up for the Sea Scholar's. I do hope you enjoy being a part of the guild.
