Ah, I see you've come across a skeleton key. This key is said to have been made by a highly skilled blacksmith named Ealgar. No one knows quite how he did it, but somehow Ealgar managed to create a key with the ability to open many different types of locks. Hearsay is that Ealgar was accused of being a thief for creating such an item and lost his reputation.
