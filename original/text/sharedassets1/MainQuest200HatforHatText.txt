You see, I am a big proponent of the "hat for a hat" mentality. And since those nasty pirates stole my hat, it is only fitting that I steal theirs in return. Maybe you could issue some vengeance on my behalf. I hear the pirates keep a hat that used to belong to an old Captain of theirs stored in a silver chest on one of their inhabited islands. But be wary, the pirates that would have the hat are tougher than the ones that stole mine. Look for an island with tree stumps and pirate flags. Also, the orange tint to the island foliage is a hint that there is a band of tough pirates dug in there. 

To open the chest you're going to need a silver key. If you need one of those, I can direct you to a nearby merchant who may have one for sale. Once you have the key, then find the island and steal their hat! Once you bring it back to me, we can talk rewards.
