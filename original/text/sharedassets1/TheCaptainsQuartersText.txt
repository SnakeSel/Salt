In the Captain's quarters is where I stand
In the darkened corner with muffins in hand
In my blood I feel revenge flowing red
With crumbs tumbling down from the fluffy bread

In the Captain's head, oh I shall be
When he finds his muffins abandoned thee
In the Captain's quarters is where I stand
In the darkened corner with muffins in hand
