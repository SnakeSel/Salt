Well well. You have certainly moved your way up the ranks. I've got one more task for you if you think you can handle it. 

I'm looking for a book to finish off my philosophical collection. The book is titled Life, Death, and the Sea. There weren't very many of these books written and so they are quite rare. I believe high ranking pirates may have obtained some copies. My sources tell me there's a pirate known as an Elite Captain that resides on islands with pirate strongholds. Perhaps he has one on him or has one stored in a chest nearby. 

Bring me this, and you will truly be a Sea Scholar. Oh, and be careful. These pirates are not to be underestimated.
