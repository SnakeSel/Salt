Four spirits of the world are we,
Earth, Fire, Air, and Sea.
Ponder well and carefully,
And choose the coin of me.

The first of us supports the rest,
The third of us within its breast,
The other two upon its chest,
And stable as can be.

The second spirit loves to prance,
Invites the fourth along to dance,
Engaging in a fierce romance
That riles up the sea.


The third will flourish on the first,
and never quells its endless thirst.
It finds the fourth to be accursed,
And smothered, it will flee.

The fourth has attributes of worth
Corresponding to its girth.
These features, though, you must unearth,
For the fourth is me.

Four spirits of the world are we,
Earth, Fire, Air, and Sea.
Ponder well and carefully,
And choose the coin of me.
