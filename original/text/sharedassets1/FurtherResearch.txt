Now that you have worked your way up to the highest status in the Sea Scholar's Guild, it's time to continue the research. But do not fret, you shall be rewarded for your endeavors. We take care of our own, afterall. 

As you are out there in the world, collect any books you find. I'll trade you a token for each book. If you collect seven of my tokens, I will reward you with something from the Sea Scholar's Guild Chest. 

And remember, always stay true in your search for knowledge.
