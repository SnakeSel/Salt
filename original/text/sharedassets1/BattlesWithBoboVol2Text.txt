Battles With Bobo Vol. 2
 
 
Entry 4

The time was now. The pirates had gone off in search of who knows what, and the camp appeared empty. I looked carefully around the camp to ensure there was no danger. If I had any hope of retrieving that blade that I must act now! My pulse quickened and I darted my way towards the camp. Each step I took meant another chance for the pirates to come back. As I finally made my way to the blade, my suspicions were verified. This was indeed my sword! 


After all these years I had found my way back to my blade. Seeing it here in front of me felt surreal. As I looked on to the blade I was reminded of my home. A flood of memories swept into my mind and time seemed to slow. Nevertheless, there was no time for sentiment. I needed to grab the blade and get out of there, lest I be captured. 

Entry 5

I quickly snatched up the sword and fastened it onto my belt. The weight of the blade felt right at home on my side. As I turned around to leave I heard the sound of chatter. The pirates were coming back! I had to leave now. With haste I turned towards the forest line and ran towards the trees maintaining as much stealth as I could bare. The chatter was growing louder but I knew they hadnâ€™t seen me yet. I could do this! I could make it out of here alive. 


Within a mere ten feet from the tree line I felt a sharp pain strike through my leg. It felt like fire running through my veins and I tumbled to the ground, grunting in agony. Looking down at my leg I saw an arrow sticking through the flesh. My hope of escape had come to an end. 

I had been caught.
