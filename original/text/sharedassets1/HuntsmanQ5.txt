Well well, you've proven to be quite capable. I think you are now worthy of buying my splintering arrows. I'll give you a few for free to start. These are high damage but break easy, so be sure and be as accurate as possible. I'll even give you the knife I use to make the arrows. In exchange for a tiger's fang of course.
