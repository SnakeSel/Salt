Entry 1

I’ve finally done it! I’ve finally found a way to make the skeleton key. Years back during my travels I discovered an old and unreadable tablet. In the tablet there was a drawing of a key. I couldn’t understand any of the writings but it seemed to be describing this key. For some reason I had an insatiable urge to discover it’s meaning so I set sail to find a historian. Rumor has it these historians know a thing or two about ancient languages.

After many days of traveling I finally found a historian. His name was Redlen. I had to pay him a hefty sum for the translation but he eventually told me what it said. It was instructions on how to make the key! This was joyful news to my ears. With my background in blacksmithing, I should have little problem making this device. I’m going to get to work as soon as possible and see if I can make this key!

I’m happy to report the craft was successful. I gathered all the required ingredients and have finally finished. It’s such a beautifully crafted device. So far I’ve found this key will unlock nearly everything I throw at it. However, I should be careful with such power, lest people think I use it for wrongdoing.
