The Cursed Skull: Vol 2
 
 
Entry 3

I had heard tales of ruins but had never seen one for myself. They are rumored to be cursed places left behind by savages and natives of the jungle. I felt fear surge through my bones and I began to doubt whether or not I should enter this place. I then remembered why I had come here in the first place. To find something! To have an adventure! I couldn’t turn back now and flee in fear the moment something dangerous arose. I had to go in and see what I could find. For all I knew it could be harmless. All I had heard were tales anyways. They probably didn’t even have any truth to them. It was time to head in. 


Entry 4

The closer I drew to the ruin the more I could see of it’s detail. Atop a stone doorway, etched into the stone, stood a large carving of a skull. The eyes contained two red gems that seemed to stare directly at me. This certainly wasn’t a good sign, but I refused to let myself turn back. I slowly approached the doorway and peered in to see if I could make out anything. The corridor was a void of black. I couldn’t see anything and there was no way I was stepping into that place without a light source. 

I quickly scavenged up the materials needed for a torch and headed in. The light seemed to dance off the walls and I could only see maybe five to ten feet in front of me. I kept moving forward, never really knowing what to expect next. 


The first corridor I walked down finally opened up into a large chamber. The room was so large that I couldn’t make much out. I found some torches placed on the side of the walls and lit them with mine. Once I had all the torches lit, I could finally make out the room. What I saw terrified me.
