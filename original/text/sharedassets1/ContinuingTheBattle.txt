You've done well by us as a member of the Sea Hunters and for that I am thankful. However, the battle still isn't over. Our enemies from beasts of the jungle to the highest ranking pirates still roam the lands and leave behind a path of destruction wherever they go. 

If you'd like to continue earning some of our most rare gear, you must continue the fight. 

From now on, when you kill certain high level enemies, look for a token they can drop. For every seven tokens you turn into me, I will reward with some nice loot from our armory.
