Rejoice! Today is a day of prosperity! 

In my recent hunting expedition, I came across a red â€˜x' on the ground. It looked rather particularly so I came back to my shack, grabbed my shovel, and headed out to dig up this mystery. What I found was a treasure chest with gold and other valuables stored inside! I couldn't believe my eyes! My joy was as radiant as the sun! 

I have always been a poor man, destined to hunting and selling pelts for gold. No longer! With this newly found treasure I will set out on an adventure and make myself a new man! 

I have everything packed and plan on leaving today. I can't wait to see what lies beyond the sea!
