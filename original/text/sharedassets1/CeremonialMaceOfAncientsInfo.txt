I...I'm surprised to see you have that item. I wasn't even sure it existed. That mace is said to be an immensely powerful weapon. Rumor had it that the mace was lost and would never be found again. Not much is known about its history but an item this powerful has bound to have seen evil use in its day. I'm not sure how you came about acquiring such a relic, but take heed -- an item like this is not to be taken lightly.
