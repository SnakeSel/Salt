You have it? You have the eel? Give it here, quickly! . . . *zzzt* OUCH! . . . Ah, sweet relief. My ankles. They are starting to feel normal again. Thank you my friend. As promised, here is my Skimmy. Goodbye Skimmy. We have tasted many salty waves together. You and I have had many adventures, and you have seen many great things. Now it is time to see the world from the perspective of a new captain. It will be good for you. May your sails ever rustle in the breeze of glory.
