I have to say, I am quite proud of you! You've come so far since you first requested to join our guild. I have only one more task for you before you are considered a member. 

Out in the ocean you will sometimes fish up some flotsam, or wreckage that gets lost from ships. These ships used to carry an oil that us fisherman used to clean our fishing poles with. It left the poles with a shine like you wouldn't believe. I would really like to get my hand on some of that oil. 

See if you can fish up some flotsam, then open it up and find me some Fisherman's Cleaning Oil!
