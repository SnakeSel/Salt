In pirate land there was a man
Named Sir Gregor Fussy Pants
He wailed and toiled when he awoke
Only to find his bootie broke

How could he a Captain's man
Plunder and pillage the richest lands
With no affection round his toes
With no protection from his foes

Sir Gregor was no common folk
So he set out to fix what broke
He searched the islands high and low
For a tailor named Henry Fro

Henry was a man of feet
Building shoes so he could eat
He built the boots at beck and call
He built the strongest of them all


When Gregor came to Henry Fro
He knew he'd found his long lost hope
He looked at him with tearful eyes
Then down to where his bootie lie

With one quick glance Henry knew
Why Sir Gregor had come so soon
He took a hammer and some tools
He grabbed some leather and a stool

So oft to work went Henry Fro
On the boot for Gregor's toes
He finished quickly as he could
As Sir Gregor knew he would

And now with pride Sir Gregor rose
With brand new fervor and brand new hope
He thanked Henry for all he'd done
And set back out towards the ocean sun


And so is the story of Gregor's boot
And the tale of his new loot
With every struggle and every strife
Comes new adventures and new life
