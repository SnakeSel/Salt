Long ago, the day that I was born
I knew that I was destined to explore
Something in me down beneath my skin
Just yearned for something more

So I packed my bags, never looking back
And I planned out my attack
I felt the wind and I felt the sun
My adventure has begun

I'll go where the wind takes me I'll have no fear
I'll lift up my anchor and sail to the clear
I'll go where my heart takes me open the vault
My hair full of sand and my mouth full of salt

So I here I am, the waves beneath my feet
And the airs smells fresh and sweet
Though danger lurks at every single turn
It's a fate for which I yearn


I'll go where the wind takes me I'll have no fear
I'll lift up my anchor and sail to the clear
I'll go where my heart takes me open the vault
My hair full of sand and my mouth full of salt
