So it's done is it? Looks as though I put my faith in the right person. I suppose for now we can celebrate since Draegan has been vanquished, though true evil such as that is never really gone. After all, this isn't the first time he's been defeated and found a way to return. We must stay vigilant! 

But for now, board your boat and set sail for the horizon. Find new adventures and new tales. Until next time traveler. The world thanks you for your deeds.
