Eliza's Diary Part Four

Entry 7

The massive sculpture towered above us, casting its gaze down on even the tallest trees. In all my travels I had never seen a structure such as this. Although the statue was as still as stone, it felt as though it were alive. 

The whistling sound seemed to be emanating from the stone giant. As we gazed upon the statue my feeling of dread only strengthened. I knew we needed to leave this place and get far, far away. I grabbed Thomas by the wrist and told him that we needed to leave. He must have felt the same sense of dread I did as he did not protest in the least. We quickly left the stone structure and headed back to our home. 


Entry 8

Thomas and I don’t talk about that night much anymore. We’ve sinced moved our home to a different island and don’t plan on returning anytime soon. I don’t know what would have erected such a statue far into the forest as we were that night, nor do I care to find out. 

These days Thomas and I spend our time fishing and hunting, mainly living off the land. I still have nightmares about the statue and occasionally think I hear the whistling sound. Nevertheless, I feel safe with Thomas. I think we can have a good life here. I think we can be happy.
