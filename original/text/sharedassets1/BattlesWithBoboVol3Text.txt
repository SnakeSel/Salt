Battles With Bobo Vol. 3
 
 
Entry 6

I knew the moment my leg was shot that my hope was dwindling. There was no way I would be able to outrun the pirates now. 

Immediately after being shot in the leg the pirates surrounded me and took me captive into their village. They threw me in one of their huts and left me there alone for what seemed like days. All I could think about while in that hut was the ocean. I dreamt of being back on my ship sailing the open sea. 


Entry 7

After what seemed like an eternity, their leader finally came into the hut. I figured at this point I would be interrogated and eventually left for dead. he calmly walked into the hut and placed chair in front of me. His eyes never shifting from my own as he sat down. This pirate appeared much more refined than the others. More sophisticated. 

“I am Bobo,” he introduced himself. Bobo? Strange name for such a sophisticated looking pirate. “Tell me, why have you come to this island?” I knew that it mattered not what I said, my fate would be all the same. I chose to stay in silence. 


“The quiet type, huh?” He quickly rose from his chair and left the hut. A few moments later he reappeared but this time with my sword. With the a loud thud the sword landed in front of me as he tossed it aside. “Is this what you’ve come for? Go ahead. Take it.” What was he playing at? Surely he wasn’t going to just give me the sword and let me go free. 

With hesitation I slowly reached down and grabbed the sword. It felt good to hold my blade again. We had seen many adventures together. The sword felt more like an extension of my own arm instead of a weapon. 

“I’ll let you leave this island and keep the weapon on one condition. You must defeat me in a duel.”
