I heard Petey saying the other day that he heard rumors of a jungle way out at sea. According to him these jungles can only be found in the deepest parts of the ocean, containing all kinds of mysteries and dangers. I'd like to go out and find one but don't know the exact place to look. Petey told me that the Innkeeper may know the location of such islands, for a price. I'll be heading to speak with him soon and perhaps make my trek into the jungle.
