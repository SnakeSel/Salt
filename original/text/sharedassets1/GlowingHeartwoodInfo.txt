You say you actually found some glowing heartwood? I'm all astonishment. I didn't believe the legends, but now I am doubting my disbelief. You see, legend has it that there were these powerful druids that lived long ago. They mainly kept to themselves, preferring to keep company with nature rather than people, you know. 

Well, there was some kind of great conflict involving them. I am not sure what got them all riled up, but the word is, thousands of pirates lost their lives in the event. In the end, however, the druids were somehow defeated. The legend is, that even though they lost their bodies, their spirits endured. And I was told if I ever were to find a tree with glowing heartwood, that was the spirit of one of the slain druids. Sleeping. Waiting for the right time to return to the world to seek their revenge.

If it were me who found some glowing heartwood, I would try to appease the druid living inside it. Take the glowing heartwood, some hardwood, and the whittling knife you have to make his spirit a more fitting home.
