The Captain knows! He has to know. I thought I was being sneaky, stealing his favorite shiny. I thought I could be long gone before that fool found out. But he smelled me. He sensed me! He felt his shiny slipping through his cold fingers. 

Knowing the Captain was on to me, I set out for the sea with his precious shiny hoping to get a head start before he could chase after me. I didn't make it far before I saw his ships tailing me. They wanted the shiny but it is mine! Thankfully a storm came and I was able to lose them for the time being. 


I've found this island and docked here for the night. Just me and the shiny, all alone at last. I plan on heading back out in the morning before the Captain can find me. His shiny will be mine and mine alone!
