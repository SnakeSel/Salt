Eliza's Diary Part Two

Entry 3

After much persistence I finally convinced Thomas to go with me into the night. It had been too long since we tasted adventure and with him at my side, I wasnâ€™t afraid. The night fell hard and fast, leaving us little time to prepare. We headed back to my cottage and readied ourselves for the adventure. Both of us primarily use a bow as our weapon of choice, and so we stocked up on as many arrows as we had. We also grabbed a few torches for light and some bandages in the event one of us became hurt. We were ready for our adventure. 


Entry 4

By the time we left the safety of the cottage, night had taken over the forest. Thankfully the moon was fully alive and we could see with some degree of clarity. I looked at Thomas as he lead the way and felt a sense of security and safety that I never felt on my own. He was my protector. 

As we delved deeper into the forest, the limbs of the trees seemed to curl in and come alive. I could hear the wind whistling through the leaves and suddenly a strange feeling came over me. Something felt wrong.
