I haven't seen many of these on my travels, but I do recall one interesting fellow who had one. He was a merchant who was also dabbling into the culinary arts. Upon seeing that I was a fisherman, he insisted on showing me his lure, and inquired as to if I had any sharks to sell to him. The lure he had was white in color.
