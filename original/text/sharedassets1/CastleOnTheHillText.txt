The sun cries over the looming mountain
The trees dancing to the sky of love
The sea swaying like a moving fountain
With the castle on the hill above

The men come down with shining weapons
They wield their blades with mighty gloves
Their eyes burn red with looks that threaten
With the castle on the hill above


The swords plunge into the enemy armor
The screams cry out like a mourning dove
Their eyes turn cold like a weeping martyr
With the castle on the hill above

The wolf cries out at the end of battle
The moon shines over the field of blood
The wind moving like a dying candle 
With the castle on the hill above
