Ah so you'd like to know more about the Sea Fisher's Guild huh? Very well then. 

The Sea Fisher's Guild was founded a long time ago by a man named Mervyn Boyd. Many think it was actually Mervyn who invented the fishing pole, plunging us from the old ancient ways of using spears and bows to the fine art of the lure and string. At any rate, Mervyn is largely responsible for our guild as we know it today. 

We here at the Sea Fisher's Guild lead a simple life, though we do have certain rules we adhere to. These rules are known as "The Three Tenets of the Sea Fishers." The tenets are as follows: 

Tenet Number One: All Sea Fishers shall respect the law of the sea and not take part in piracy or other unbecoming behaviors. 

Tenet Number Two: All Sea Fishers shall reciete the Sea Fisher's Oath every morning before they begin fishing. 

Tenet Number Three: All Sea Fishers will respect other members and help new guild members to become better fishermen. 

That's it. Quite simple. Oh, and you'll need to know the Sea Fisher's Oath should you join the guild. It is as follows: 

"I swear to adhere to the Sea Fisher's Tenants to the best of my ability. I will respect my fellow members of the guild, I will respect the sea, and I will constantly strive to be a better fisher than the day before."

So that about sums it up then. Good luck on your journey into the Sea Fisher's Guild!
