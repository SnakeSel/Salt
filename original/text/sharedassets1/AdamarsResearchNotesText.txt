I think I've finally found a way to cure my wife's desease. Apparently there's a jewel with mysterious healing properties. The jewel is rumored to have been locked away centuries ago in a cursed chest. The only information I could find about the chest was that one needed a moonrock key in order to open it. 

I have recently discovered the required components to make such a key. The crafting of the moonrock key required four moonrock ore shards and a mineral known as Calamite. I still have some of the mineral left over and will keep it for future use. 


Now with the key in my possession, I must find the location of the cursed chest. I'm heading out tomorrow to speak to a Sea Scholar. They are usually the wisest in the region when it comes to knowledge of these sorts of things. Perhaps they will know something. 

I have to find this jewel and above all, I have to save my wife.
