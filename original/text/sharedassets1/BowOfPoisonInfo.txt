Ah, so it does exist. The long fabled Bow of Poison. I had heard many tales about such a weapon, but was never fully convinced that it actually existed. The bow is said to have belonged to an archer by the name or Arnath. Little is know about Arnath, but apparently he was one of the most skilled archers that ever lived. How he came to acquire the Bow of Poison, or how he lost it, no one knows. Its whereabouts were a mystery until now.
