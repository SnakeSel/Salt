Here for another assignment? Very well. 

I want you to retrieve a book titled Building Ships: A Beginner's Guide. Ive always been interested in learning just how one builds a ship. It seems like quite a good time to craft something like a mighty vessel and sail towards the horizon! Will I do it? Eh, well see. 

As with most things, Im sure pirates have come into possession of it. I hear there are a number of pirates that deal particularly in this field. Some are known as cartographers, navigators, and even shipwrights. Perhaps one of these pirates would have the book Im looking for.
