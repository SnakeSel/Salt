Dressed to the nines, I see. Very good. Luck and superstition is a very important part of fishing, and you must take this into account if you are to be great. I've been doing some thinking about our elusive pink friend. I have no idea what type of bait he would be attracted to. Believe me, I've tried all that I had. So, we must work with what we do know. We know that he is pink and small. Therefore, if we use a lure that is small and pink like him, maybe it will pique his interest enough to get close and hooked.

A pink lure is something I have never used or seen before, but I suppose it would be simple enough to combine together a red lure with a white lure and mix up all of their little strands to make it appear pink. I have neither a red or white lure to spare, sadly, so for that you are on your own.
