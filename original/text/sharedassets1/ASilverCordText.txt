Good heavens! Someone actually came. And here I thought the days of song were lost. 

Eh erm...well allow me to introduce myself. I am The Composer. It is my sworn duty to sing and bring melodies to this treacherous land. 

You look...inexperienced...but maybe we can work you up into something worthwhile. Admittedly, it's been quite some time since I've had an apprentice. My last apprentice was...well nevermind. If you're really interested in learning the art of melody, then I suppose you'll have to do. 

First, we need to get you an instrument. How about a lute? I'll tell you what. If you're serious about this, bring me a silver cord. Where will you find one? Oh, must I do everything! Fine. Check pirate chests. They often mine such ore and will likely have one. 

Bring me the cord, and I'll see if I can fashion you a lute.
