Well you've proven to be quite the apprentice. I'm proud to have taken you under my wing, though there is still more to do if you are interested.

A few years ago I was caught up in a huge storm at sea. I survived but the storm sucked up years of songwriting and scattered them across the world. 

If you happen to come across my lost songsheets, bring them to me and I will reward you for every five you turn in. I have a good stash of rewards so keep bringing me more and I will continue to reward you. 

Now on with you, I've got music to compose...
