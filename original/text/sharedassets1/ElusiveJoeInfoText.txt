Elusive Joe is the big prize that I am currently after. That's what I have come to call it anyway. It's a rather small pink fish that I caught a glimpse of a long time ago. I was sitting on the shore of a jungle island much like this one. I had just stopped fishing to grab me a bite to eat. That's when I saw a little pink fella pop his eye out of the water and stare at me. He stared at me for just longer than was comfortable to be stared at by a fish, and then under he went. Ever since then, he has been in the back of my mind. I'd even trade my lucky hat to add the little pink fish to my collection.

To even have a shot at being a lucky enough fisherman to catch him, you must first dress like a proper fisherman. I can help you there. I have some very lucky fishing clothes that you can have in exchange for some of the other fish that I am missing from my collection. When you are wearing a full set of fishing clothes, come back and talk to me and I'll give you some more information on Elusive Joe.
