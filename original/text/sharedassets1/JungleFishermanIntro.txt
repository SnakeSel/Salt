Well, hello there. Are you a fisherman too? I love fishing. In fact, I would go so far as to call it my life's purpose. I am a collector of fish. I count myself very lucky to live in a world with so much water, filled with so many types of fish. I hear that there are some exotic fish that swim near these jungle islands. You're welcome to help me find some of the ones that I haven't yet been able to catch. If you find one, I'll trade you for it.
