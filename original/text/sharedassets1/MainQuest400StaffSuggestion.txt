Do you remember those cultists that I told you about? Well they carry some powerful artifacts. According to my studies, the staves that they carry have some interesting properties. They sacrifice some of their own blood in order to imbue the staves with extra strength. Don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea. If you can obtain one of these staves, and affix the cleansed skull on top, I would be willing to bet it would make a very powerful weapon.

Take note that you should not use the white staff that you used to cleanse the skull for this purpose. The white staff would subdue the power still contained in the skull, which would make for a very inept weapon indeed.
