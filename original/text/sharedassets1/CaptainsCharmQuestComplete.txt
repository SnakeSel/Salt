Ah, so you've done what I've asked. Good on you, and welcome to the guild! 

I think it's safe now to let you access some of our wares. We've been stocking up all kinds of items for years now. Since you are merely an initiate I can't trust you with our best gear, but continue to prove yourself and I'll consider it. As you rank up with the guild I'll give you access to new and better weapons, armor, and other items. 

In order to rank up, complete the tasks I ask of you, without question. Your loyalty will be rewarded.
