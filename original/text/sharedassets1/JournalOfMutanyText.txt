Journal of Mutany

Entry 1

The captain said that this journal would be a good idea. Got too many thoughts on my mind, and better I place them safely on a page than let them into the wild, says he. The pigwollop. Ha! Yes. I just badmouthed the captain. Here in the safety of this book. Here where my words will find the escape they desire. It is a glorious day.
 
 
Entry 2

I don't know what the captain expects us to find here. We've been going from island to island for days, and have nothing to show for it save for a few logs.  The pigwollop.


Entry 3

Saw a white deer yesterday. Swear I did. The captain says I'm full of pete. It ain't the case. I saw it I did. Out of the corner of my eye behind some brush. I saw white then it was gone.

Entry 4

Captain almost read my journal. I left it on the ground next to the campfire while I went for a stroll. On my way back, I saw him eyballing it with his big pigwollop eye. I think I'll make a decoy tomorrow and see if I can catch him in the act.


Entry 5

Made a decoy journal and left it where he could find it. Found it he did. Eyeball it hard he did. I know he wanted to read it. I could see his cogs a-turnin'. He didn't though. Maybe he is afraid of what he will find. Yes! The captain is afraid of my thoughts. He is afraid I am smarter than he is. I am. I always have been. I should have been captain. I should be captain. I will be captain. The pigwollop.


Entry 6

Today was a depressing day. I made my attack at the captain. It was a good attack too. He just laughed at me as my attack bounced off. He knew about my plan and had donned his metal under his tunic where I couldn't see it. I don't know how he knew about my plan. I have kept this journal safe. He couldn't have known. He couldn't have read it. Could he? Here I sit. Alone on this beach watching the sails of my home sink below the horizon as I write.

Now they are gone.
