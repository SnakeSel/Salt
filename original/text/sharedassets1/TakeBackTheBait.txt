You did good catching the sea bass. Now I need you do something a little more...hands on. We Sea Fishers generally try to avoid violence when possible. However, we've recently had our stash of lures ransacked by a band of pirates. They made off with some valuable lures. One of those lures was a personal item given to me by someone I onced love. I want that lure back. 

It's an orange lure and I'm sure if you search some low level pirates you are bound to find it. Bring it back to me and we'll talk more gear.
