Hello there,

Lenvell sent you, did he? Ah, you must be after the key. And here I thought this was just a chance meeting. Well at any rate, I've hidden it somewhere, and only I know of its location. I suppose if Lenvell wants you to have the key, then it must be pretty important

Alright, I tell you what. I'll give you the location of the key, but you've got to do something for me first. Have you seen these poachers roaming this island? They carry with them a special lure that could be very useful to me as a fisherman. Unfortunately I've tried to offer them money for the lure, but they will not sell it. 

Obtain that lure and bring it back to me. Once this is done, I'll give you the location of the key.
