This note...it's from Lilly? Oh my. I can't think of anything more valuable than this. You have truly outdone yourself. Here, I have something for you. I've been holding on to these for a long time but I think it's time I pass them on. 

About a year ago I came across two odd boxes. After some research I discovered they are what the scholars call Riddle Boxes. No one knows who made these or where they came from but it has been discovered that they require specific coins to open. 

The riddle on these two boxes has to do with the elements. Knowing this I set out to obtain the associated coins and I have finally found them: earth, air, fire, and water. Unfortunately I still haven't solved the riddle and I'm too afraid to use the coins I have. 

According to the scholars, the riddle boxes will only reveal their contents if the correct coin is inserted. Put in the wrong coin and the box will dissipate. 

Here, you take these boxes and the riddle. I only have two boxes you'll have a couple tries. I hope that you find something valuable inside.
