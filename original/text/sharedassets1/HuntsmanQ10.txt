I... I have something to say to you. Let me preface this with saying that this is not easy for me to  say. I am a very proud man. However, you have proven yourself to me, and are worthy of hearing my secret, and perhaps helping me, if you would. 

You see, one day while tromping through the jungle as usual, I was a little too distracted. My conceit allowed me to believe I was impervious to making novice mistakes, especially after a lifetime of making none. I... I... I stepped on a poisonous plant. My ankles were poisoned. Forgive me if this somehow lowers your perception of my prestige, but I humbly ask your aid in the matter. 

I know exactly how to remedy the issue, but the solution is sadly beyond my reach. All of my life it has been my intelligence and capability that I have leaned on for success. Not once have I ever resorted to luck to solve one of my problems. I have no skill or experience in being lucky. It is, therefore, fittingly unlucky that luck would be my only chance at salvation. It is the key to my prison of demise.

I know of the existence of an eel with the properties that I need. Its shock will denature the poison in my veins. I am not well learned in the ways of fishing, but I know you need two things to catch this eel. One, is this eel bait that I obtained through dubious means. Second, you have to have a special kind of fisherman's luck. 

This fisherman's luck I do not possess. Can you somehow obtain this eel for me? In exchange for the eel, I will trade you one of my boats. I call her my little jungle skimmy. I would miss her, but my ankles can bear no more.
