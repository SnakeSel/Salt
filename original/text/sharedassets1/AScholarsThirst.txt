Yes, what can I do for you? Oh...you say you are looking for named Adamar? Hm...Adamar...Adamar...the name sounds familiar

Oh yes! I remember a man that went by that name. He came by here recently in search of some information regarding a cursed chest. While we do have information in regards to such an item, we can't just give it out for free. I told Adamar that if he wanted the information he needed to retrieve an item for us. Unfortunately he hasn't returned. Perhaps you'd like to pick up where he left off? 

If you'd like to know more about the chest, bring me a bottle of Hermington's Brew. The brew is a rare ale that is generally only found in use by high ranking pirates, particularly pirates known as Elite Captains. The pirates merely drink it for the taste but the brew is known to have certain alchemical properties that could prove useful to us in our research. 

You can find these captains patrolling around pirate fortresses so look for those to find the brew. Bring it back here once you have it and I'll give you the information you need.
