What is this? Oh my. This...this charm belonged to a dear friend of mine by the name of Adamar. He left a while ago on some dead end quest in search of this, Jewel of Eranath, if it even exists. I tried to convince him not to go on this wild goose chase but he would not listen. You finding this charm gives me great concern over his safety. 

Perhaps you could look into this matter for me? I don't really know where you could start, but Adamar did leave behind a few things. He had some research notes and this strange piece of mineral that I had never heard of. In his notes I believe he mentioned something about a key and a Sea Scholar or something along those lines.

I don't know, perhaps you could start there?
