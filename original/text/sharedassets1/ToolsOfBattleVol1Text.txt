Tools of Battle vol. 1
By: Horace the Iron Master

With the right tools, a novice can surpass a master in battle. I have dedicated much of my adventuring life to the art of weaponry. Contained in this volume are sampling of tools that will change you from a flopping baitfish to a battle ready warrior.

Hardwood
Most island hoppers quickly learn to carve themselves out a club for basic self-defense. If you are weaponless, by all means, make you a weapon out of the first bit of wood you find. However, few know how to select the right wood for a fine club. Look for a log of pure hardwood. It will provide you with a much better and satisfying bonk on whatever foe crosses your path. This goes the same for bows and arrows. Some mighty fine arrows can be made from hardwood and hardstone.


Dagger
Some prefer the stealthy ways. To those, I suggest a solid dagger. They may not be as good for a face-to-face fight as some larger weapons, but they are quick, and can deal a devastating blow if used for a backstab. Use hardstone ore to craft a small pointed blade, and form the hilt from strands of deer pelt.

Scimitar
This is a mighty fine weapon, though the materials to make it properly are difficult to obtain. The thin curved blade must be made from a very strong material. You will need a couple of ironite ores to craft the blade. The hilt must be made of hardwood, and wrapped with strips of a pristine pelt.

Moonrock Sword
The night is often aglow with a mysterious ore that seems to magnify the moonlight. I have


only ever been able to mine small shards of it at a time, but persistance will win you enough to craft a fair blade. Attach the blade to a hilt of hardwood.
