If you dont't want to spend your days sailing around in circles, you are going to have to become familiar with some navigation techniques. First off, learn your cardinal directions. North, South, East, and West. They are of utmost importance. Some of these pirates that come through here haven't even heard of the words judging by thier lack of direction. One time, I convinced a pirate that had come by here a day earlier that this was an entirely different inn than the one he had visited.

One of the most basic tools of navigation are the celestial bodies. The Sun and Moon. They appear to rise from the eastern horizon, and set upon the western horizon. Memorize this, and you are already way ahead of most of the scallywags around these parts. Of course, if you find yourself a compass, it does help with the neck cramps at mid-day, if you know what I mean.

Finding your exact location in the world would be a little bit more difficult than just looking at the position of the sun. Luckily, we have a tool for that. It's called a sextant. With it, you wil be able to pinpoint your current position down to the accuracy of a small island's breadth. If you don't have one yet, let me know and I may have a spare one that you can have.
