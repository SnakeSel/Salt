With the three items obtained, we can bring back Draegan ourselves and end this once and for all. It's dangerous, but he won't be expecting it.

First, I believe I know why the Cultist wanted these three items. Through my study of Cultist lore, I've come to learn a great deal about them. The Cultist worship three main ideas: destruction, death, and darkness. Each of these items is a representation of these ideas. 

The amulet represents destruction as it hangs from the neck of one who destroys anything that fetches a price. The tiger fang represents death, as it sinks into the flesh of its victims, devouring their lives. The ring represents the darkness, using a material only found in the shadows. 

According to Cultist lore, Draegan must be brought back with a summoning rune. These runes are rare and very difficult to find. Lucky for us I happen to know where one is. When you get to the rune, you'll need to have all three items. When you do, put your hand on the rune and the summoning should begin. 

Oh, and before you go. I have something I want to give you. It's a cloak that was given to me by my father. The cloak will help you should you fall in need. Wear it with honor. Now go, and good luck. I hope we meet again.
