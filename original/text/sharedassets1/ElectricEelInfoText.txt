Yes, of course. The electric eel. I have one in my collection. If I recall correctly, and I have excellent memory when it comes to where and how I caught each fish, I caught one using eel bait while wearing my lucky fishing hat. Boy was that eel bait nasty business to get. It disgusts me just to think about it. Anyway, if you are in dire need of the eel, I can trade you one for a blue crab.
