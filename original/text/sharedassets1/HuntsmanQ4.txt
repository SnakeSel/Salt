As if the mosquitos gnawing at my ankles wasn't enough, there is yet another threat against my walkers. The poachers are at it again, yet this time with their traps. All through my jungles they have hatched their traps hungry for fresh ankles. 

If you could disarm and take a few of these, I'd be very grateful. Three should do.
