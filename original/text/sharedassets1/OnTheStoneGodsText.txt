Strange things they are. Beings made of stone. Who has ever heard of such magic? 

I remember when I first came upon one. I believed it to be a dream the way he stared down upon me, his eyes on fire like the sun. The fear and awe was incredible. I could do nothing but get on my hands and knees in adoration of such power. Thinking he may choose to take my life, I closed my eyes and waited for my judgement, but it did not come. Instead I felt the warmth of the sun return and the birds song begin again. When I opened my eyes, the great stone god was gone. 

I questioned the experience itself. Had I had an illusion? Was this all some sort of dream? It was then that I noticed the dagger in front of me. It was not there before. The dagger looked curved, like a snake. It was made of some kind of strange stone. I don’t know how yet, but this dagger has to have some connection to the stone god. 


I’ve now made it my life’s purpose to find this being again, though I’m not sure what will happen when I do.
