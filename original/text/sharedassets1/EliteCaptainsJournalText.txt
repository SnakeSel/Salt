Yesterday some fool thought he'd try and steal my brew. When I caught him red handed he then offered to buy it. Said he needed it to get some information from some scholar. Well, unlucky for him I don't take people trying to steal my things very nicely. So I taught him a lesson or two. 

Let's just say no one will be seeing him around anytime soon. Oh, and when I was done with him I took his gold and some petty ring he had. I'll probably sell it soon when I get a chance. Maybe it'll make the whole thing worthwhile.
