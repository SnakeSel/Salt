Dear James,

Tomorrow we embark on yet another adventure across the seas. I feel as though our journey so far has brought a light to my life I previously only dreamed of. Traveling the world, playing music, and never knowing what's next is truly a dream come true. 

I hope that we have many more years of life and love together but no matter what, I want you to know that these past few years have been some of the best years of my life, and I will always be thankful for that. 
 
  
   

Love, 
Lilly
