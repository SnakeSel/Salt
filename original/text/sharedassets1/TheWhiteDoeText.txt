I saw her. Plain as day. The rest of the crew may think of me as crazy but I know what I saw. The Captain has sent me out on hunting duty to gather food for the crew. I took my sword and headed into the jungle. As I was hunting I noticed something moving through the foliage. It was a white doe! The most beautiful creature I had ever seen! I couldn’t believe my eyes. Deer are pretty common in these parts, but I had never seen a white one. I was conflicted as I knew what we needed to do, and the Captain would think me a fool for not killing the creature. But I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I couldn’t harm such a beautiful doe. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a pirate after all.
