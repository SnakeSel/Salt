Entry 1

Bah! I seem to have left my pickaxe laying around this island somewhere. I've got no time to be lookin' for it though.

Being an initiate, Captain Buffbeard has sent me on a mission to pillage and plunder as much as I can in the next few days. He says if I gather enough gold and valuables, that he will consider letting me join his crew. With his orders I plan on visiting as many islands as I can and killing anyone that gets in my way! It is the pirates way after all. 

The Captain said that I was to look for him on an island with wood stumps and orange tinted grass when I had enough goods. I will hurry and complete this mission. Buffbeard is not a patient man.
