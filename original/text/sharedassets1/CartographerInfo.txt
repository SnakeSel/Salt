My name is Hachure, and I am a cartographer. My life is about exploration. I learned to pinpoint my location using a sextant before I could walk. You see, my father was one of the greatest explorers to ever sail these seas, and I was under his wing from my very first memories. With every new island that we explored and charted, my passion for this life grew even more.

This is why I have dedicated my life to the art of exploration. My specialty in this area is maps. I have been creating, collecting, and studying them for years. If you share this passion, it would give me great pleasure to look over your maps. I will be happy to share with you my findings when I cross reference them with my maps.

As an incentive to come back to me with your map, I will offer you some knowledge and rewards depending on how complete and accurate it is.
