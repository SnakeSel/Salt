I love fishing. I love fishing even more than I love plundering. Should I have ever even become a pirate? I'm starting to doubt my decision. There's just a pure joy that comes from reeling a fish out of the sea. Don't get me wrong, being a pirate is fun. But it just gets boring. Plunder plunder plunder...Eventually I just want something besides gold! 

I recently heard that there was a fish in these parts called a lionfish. As a collector of sorts, I would love to get my hands on such a beauty. Maybe when the Captain's not looking I can whip my fishing rod out and catch me one. 

Ah well, I suppose only time will tell. Time to get fishing.
