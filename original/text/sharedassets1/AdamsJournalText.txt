Journal Entry 1

There isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss her. It's been two years now since I've been separated from my Joan. I told her the trek would take a year at most and that when I returned I'd have enough gold to set us up for a lifetime. Our company leader decided it best to stay longer than our contract, but has promised me that I can finally go home next month. 

I can't wait to see my wife again! Just a few more weeks and I'll be home...
