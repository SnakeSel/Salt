Ready for another assignment? Good. 

I'd like you get another book for me. Well, actually this one is more of a poem. My information tells me that the book is currently in possession of a Pirate Captain. Not sure how a Captain would come into one of these poems, nor why he would care. Maybe he has a soft spot? 

At any rate, find a Pirate Captain and see if he has the book I want. It's called Castles on the Hill. Bring it to me when you're done.
