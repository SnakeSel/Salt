White flowers are quite useful indeed. Mix two together and you'll have a simple potion with healing properties. They came in handy many times after I'd stumbled through a thorn bush. Ah yes, but that was when I was young and inexperienced, with only a few inns to manage. Anyway, if you're ever looking for more, they only seem to bloom where there is plenty of sunlight, so search any meadows and fields you come across.
