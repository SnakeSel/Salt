To truly be called a Sea Hunter, you'll need to master your skills in the dark. For your next task, I want you to hunt down and kill some spiders. These creatures can only be found wandering islands at night. I want you to bring me a spider's heart as proof of the task completed. 

The heart can be plucked out of the little ones but is more difficult to access and less common. You might have better luck with the larger spiders, should you feel up for it.
