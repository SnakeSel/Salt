You've done well so far in your tasks. Only a couple more to enter the highest ranks of the Sea Hunters and obtain access to the best of gear. 

This time I want you to hunt down a poacher. These poachers are generally found on jungle islands. They usually carry with them an amulet. Bring me this amulet as proof of a job done.
