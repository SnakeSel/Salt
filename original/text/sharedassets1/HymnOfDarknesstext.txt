This is a collection of verses written by members of the Cult. These hymns are meant to be sung before and after rituals. An elder will typically lead the group in the chant, and a sacrifice will follow after.


A Hymn of Darkness

Blessed are the givers, for they bleed
Upon the mountain in the lonely sea
Blessed are the takers, of darkened streams
Upon the temple in the sinners dream

Blessed is the fire that burns you clean
Upon the ashes of your enemies
Blessed are the six, who set you free
Upon the shouts of their victory

Never shall we die, never shall we fade
We are the rulers of the night
Never shall we cry, never shall we bleed
We are the rulers of the night
