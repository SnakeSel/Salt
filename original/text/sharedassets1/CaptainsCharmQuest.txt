You there! Are you here to join the Sea Hunter's Guild? You look like you've never heard of it...Well, I can't say I'm surprised. 

We used to be well known in these parts but I'm afraid over time our numbers have dwindled. Although it's been disheartening, it is my full intention to restore the guild to its original state. 

If you're looking to help, I could use someone like you. Though you're going to have to prove yourself first. I can't let just anybody join. I want you to prove your might by taking down a Pirate Captain. He will likely be carrying a charm on him. Bring that charm to me and we'll talk guild membership.
