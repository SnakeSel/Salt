Greetings! Are you here to join the Sea Scholars? Ah, well of course you are. Why else would you think you could approach me in such an informal manner? Do not fret, we will make a scholar of you yet! 

Alright now listen. Joining the Sea Scholars is an honorary endeavor and not one to be taken lightly. If you follow my guidance and do what I ask, you will have access to the wonderful items we have collected over the years. 

Ready for your first assignment are you? Very well then. 

I've been rather enamored with marine life lately and am seeking to learn more about them. In particular, I've taken an interest in sea turtles. There's a book titled On Sea Turtles that I would just love to get my hands on. My research has told me that certain bands of pirates often keep a copy in stock. Perhaps you should check some of their storage chests? 

Now, get to work and don't come back empty handed!
