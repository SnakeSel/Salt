So you've found a tome mentioning three trials? Hmm...so this is what the Cultist so desperately wanted to keep secret. They want Draegan summoned but only when it is time. Should someone else come across this, they could summon him and possibly fight him in a weakened state.

So apparently to complete the trials you'll need to obtain three items: a bounty hunter's Amulet, a tiger fang, and a moonrock ring. 

Obtaining the ring should be easy enough. Just keep an eye out for moonrock at night, gather enough it and you'll be able to craft it. If my memory serves me correctly, you should be able to craft it using around six pieces of moonrock and some silver ore. 

Now for the amulet. The only way to get your hand one of those amulet's is to kill a pirate bounty hunter. These pirates reside on islands filled with highly trained killers and they themselves will prove quite a challenge. I'm afraid there's no way around this one. You'll have to kill one and take his amulet. 

As for the tiger fang, that's fairly straightforward. You have experience hunting? You'll need it. Tigers are typically found lurking around the jungles. Be wary though. They are fast, cunning, and dangerous.
