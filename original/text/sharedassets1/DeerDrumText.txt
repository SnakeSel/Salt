Are you enjoying the lute? Well I do certainly hope so. 

Ah well, I suppose we can't stop there can we? There's more to music than stringed instruments. Now, we go for the foundation of melody. The rhythm! 

We're going to need to build you a drum. This time we need a high quality deer hide. The skin must be so perfectly carved that the drum has the right resonance and tonality to strike you in the chest and set your ears ablaze! 

But first you're going to need a proper skinning knife. Hunters worth their salt often use these knives so check hunting shacks to see if you can find one. Once you've got it, you'll need to hunt down a deer. The hide must be immaculate! 

Bring it here and we'll drum something up for you...oh ha ha! I am the very soul of wit.
