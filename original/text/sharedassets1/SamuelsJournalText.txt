Samuel's Journal 

I don’t typically hunt at night, but here recently food has become scarce. I’ve been forced to go out even at sunfall to hunt for deer. It was during a night hunt that I discovered what lurked in the shadows. 

It began like any normal hunt. I had equipped my sword, loaded up my bow, gathered some supplies, and headed out into the woods. I brought a torch with me for visibility as the moon was no where to be seen this night. As I traveled deeper into the woods, I began to hear strange rustling sounds. The sounds continued as I carried on through the woods. Something was following me. 


The sound was growing louder and felt as though it was closing in. This certainly wasn’t a deer, as they would have ran away by now, which means whatever was coming towards me was an enemy. I decided to play ignorant until the rustling was almost at my back. I quickly whipped around with my blade drawn, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As I turned around, leaping towards me was a giant spider! The legs were as big as tree limbs and the fangs as long as my sword. I thrusted my blade up into the air and watched as the creature fell onto the end of my sword. The pounce knocked me on my back and I watched as the spider slowly slid down the blade, letting out a loud screech as it died. 

In all my days of hunting I had never seen a creature such as this. What dark magic could be at work to cause these beasts to come out of their hell. I did not know, nor did I care to find out.
