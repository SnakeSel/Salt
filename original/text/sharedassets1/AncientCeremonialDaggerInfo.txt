I'm surprised see you have one of these in your possession. These daggers are ancient blades that were used in ritualistic sacrifices by a long forgotten race. No one is quite sure how they survived over the years, but you seem to have come across one somehow. Be careful with such a tool. It's likely the power within has not completely perished.
