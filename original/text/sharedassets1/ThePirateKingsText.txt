Though my ambition has lead me farther than I ever thought I would go, never in a million years did I expect to see a Pirate King. I knew of their existence but never thought I'd actually meet one. Rumor has it there are only four in the world. One rules the North, one the South, one the East, and one the West. 

Through years of work and dedication I've managed to climb my way up to my current rank, an Elite. I've been assigned to defend islands that contain our most valuable resources. There's really only one more rank above me. Pirates with these honors are known as Bounty Hunters. They only serve their duty should enough of us Elites fall. And then should enough Bounty Hunters fail in their duty, the King is supposed to take charge. 


Rumor has it that our entire order was started by the four Pirate Kings. Who knows though. What I do know is that they are a force to be reckoned with and should anyone stand in their way, they should be prepared for a fierce battle.
