Captain Bart's Log

Entry 1

The Captain’s been acting strange recently. Too many swigs of rum I suppose. It wasn’t but a few days ago when he decided out of the blue to stop on this god forsaken island in search of who knows what. He wouldn’t tell anyone what the reason was. Just decided to make a stop. Now we’ve been here for days and all he does is stand around that bloody campfire looking out into the horizon. 


Entry 2

It’s been weeks now. Weeks! The Captain still will give us no clue as to what we are doing here. Me and the rest of the crew are starting to grow tired of his shenanigans. I’ve been talking with a few of the other crewmates and we’ve devised a plan to overthrow him. We must be patient though. A Captain doesn’t get his title lightly. If we wait for the right moment and strike him while his back is turned, we just might can get off this island. Maybe I can even become Captain.
