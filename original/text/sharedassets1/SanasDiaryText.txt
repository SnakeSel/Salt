Sana's Diary

I think I’ve finally done it. I’ve finally made the greatest boots an explorer could ever ask for! Using my advanced skills in outfitting and through items I’ve been collecting over the years, I was able to make an exceptionally light and agile pair of boots. These boots will revolutionize the way explorers do their work. No longer will they be afraid of being eaten by creatures or killed by pirates. They will now have the ability to flee to safety and no foe shall catch them.
