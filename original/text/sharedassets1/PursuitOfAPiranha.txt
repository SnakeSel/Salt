I'd like to thank you again for getting that lure back. It means a lot to me. 

So far you've done well initiate. A few more ranks and you'll be a Master Sea Fisherman yet. Here's what I'd like you to do now. 

I'd like you to catch a Piranha. Ever heard of one? They are tiny little fish with razor like teeth. Swim up on a group of them when they are hungry and well...let's just say you'll shed some unintended weight. 

In any case, catch one of these fellas and bring it back to me. Do this and I'll unlock a higher rank of gear for you to buy.
