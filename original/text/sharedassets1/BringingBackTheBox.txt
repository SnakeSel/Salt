You did well fishing up that Piranha. You're proving to be a good Sea Fisherman so far. I've got a couple more tasks for you though before we consider you a full fledged member of the guild. 

I need you to obtain my tackle box. The box contained some of my most valuable lures and without it, I feel like a new fisherman all over again. 

The box was stolen from me by some pirates some time ago. I believe I saw them place it in a silver chest before they left me be. If you come across such a chest, check in there and lets pray you find it.
