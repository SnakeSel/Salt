You've breezed through my requests so far with ease, but now I've got a final challenge. With my ankles in prime condition, I'm nearly ready to venture back out into the jungle. However there's a particular beast that sometimes appears in the jungles of these seas, devouring any who gets in his way. He is a rare and powerful tiger known by the locals as Luthor. 

If you find Luthor in your travels, slay him. But be wary, he will be no easy foe. If you manage to kill him, cut off his tail and bring it back to me as proof. Once you do, I've got one last reward that I think you'll find of particular value.
