Bah! You won't believe what I've done! I've just put a tear in my favorite outfit. My FAVORITE outfit I tell you! And this is no ordinary outfit. No indeed. This fine grab was hand sewn by my mother, the best outfitter there ever was! God rest her soul. 

Do you...think you could help me? 

I know how to patch it up, but I'm missing a certain material. A certain, eh, difficult to obtain material. You see, one of the secrets to the longevity of this fine clothing is silk. But not just any silk...spider silk! And not just any spider, a Jungle Queen! 

A fierce and deadly foe, the Jungle Queen Spider sometimes roams jungles in the middle of the night. You look like you've seen your fair share of battle. If you can kill the beast and bring me her silk, I can fashion a very nice pair of boots
