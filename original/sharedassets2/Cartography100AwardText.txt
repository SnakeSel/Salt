100 grid locations marked now? That took some effort. You seem to have a passion for cartography. As a reward, I have adjusted your map so that you can quickly find the origin, which is location 0 North, 0 East.

Quite honestly, one thing I would love to know is why that particular location is defined as the origin. I have traveled there before and found only a small and uninteresting island. I have been able to discover no reference to the "origin" of the origin, if you catch my meaning, in any of the cartography related texts that I have read, and I have read quite a number of them. I suppose whatever the reason was, it is lost to us now.
